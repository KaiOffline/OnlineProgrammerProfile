# Kai Townsend

My name is Kai. I am a Freshman in High School in MA. I enjoy gaming and programming, and have been at it for as long as I can remember. I am also a musician and have been playing violin and in orchestras since I was little. For sports, I like to lift weights and play indoor badminton. My favorite summer place is Truro, Massachusetts (Cape Cod), where my family goes in the summer.
